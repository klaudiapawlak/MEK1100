# MEK1100 - Mandatory Assignment 1

This folder contains the first mandatory assignment for the MEK1100 course (Vector Calculus) at the University of Oslo.

## 📝 Assignment Overview

- Solving projectile motion using scaled and dimensionless variables
- Visualizing parametric curves for different launch angles
- Plotting streamlines and vector fields using quiver and contour plots
- Computing divergence and curl of a velocity field
- Analyzing properties of vector fields including circulation and stagnation points
- Using Python to simulate and visualize scalar and vector fields
- Comparing analytical results with numerical visualization

## 📄 Contents

- `assignment1_solution.pdf` – Final solution document (includes theory and results)
- `task1c.py` – Python script for plotting scaled projectile trajectories
- `task2b.py` – Python script for plotting streamlines and vector fields using quiver and contour
- `task4a.py` – Python script to visualize stream functions for two grid sizes (n = 5 and n = 30)
- `task4b.py` – Python script for defining and plotting a velocity field

## 🛠 Tools

- Python – for visualizations and calculations
- NumPy – for numerical operations
- Matplotlib – for plotting

## 🚀 How to Run

**To run the Python scripts:**

 1. Ensure you have Python 3.x installed along with NumPy and Matplotlib:
    
```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib
```

2. Run the scripts using:
   
```bash
python task1c.py
