# MEK1100 – Vector Calculus

This repository contains mandatory assignment completed as part of the MEK1100 course (Vector Calculus) at the University of Oslo.

MEK1100 gives an introduction to the theory of scalar and vector fields with applications in fluid mechanics, geophysics, and physics. The course covers key mathematical tools such as the gradient, divergence, curl, directional derivative, as well as integral theorems like Gauss’ and Stokes’ theorems. It also includes fundamental physical concepts like pressure force, particle acceleration, conservation of mass, Euler’s and Bernoulli’s equations, and the heat equation. The course introduces students to the numerical computation and visualization of scalar and vector fields using computer tools.

## 🎯 Course Objectives
- Understand scaling, the role of physical units, and the importance of dimensionless parameters
- Compute gradient, directional derivative, divergence, curl, field lines, equiscalar surfaces, curve integrals, circulation, surface integrals, and flux
- Evaluate pressure forces and particle derivatives in both Cartesian and curvilinear coordinates and understand their physical meaning
- Apply Gauss’ and Stokes’ theorems in physical and mathematical contexts
- Use potential and stream functions and understand the concept of potential flow
- Apply the equation of continuity and Euler’s equation for ideal fluid motion
- Use Bernoulli’s equation to analyze stationary fluid flow
- Understand and apply the heat equation, including heat transport by convection and Fourier’s law
- Visualize and perform numerical computations of scalar and vector fields using software tools
